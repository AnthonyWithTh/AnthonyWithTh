<h3>${\textsf{\color{green}And who Am I?}}$</h3>

>*That’s one secret I’ll never tell.*<br />

Just kidding!<br />

My name is Anthony, born in 1993.<br />
Since I was a child, I have always had a passion for video games.<br />
However, life choices have led me to study other areas, such as 3D modeling and graphic animations.<br />

In fact, in 2020 I obtained a master's degree with honors from the Faculty of Engineering of Pisa in Building Engineering Architecture.<br />
Throughout my university years I pursued my passion for video games, and only recently did I approach the world of programming.<br />
My thesis was a VR application that showed the evolution of a historic building in the Certosa di Pisa in Calci.<br />

This prompted me to undertake a training course for Game Programmer at the Digital Bros Game Academy in Milan which allowed me to expand my knowledge on the use of Unity and Unreal Engine.<br />
I found out that coding is very exciting especially with regard to the study behind the logic of a video game.<br />
I approached multiple areas such as Gameplay, UI and VFX and I found it very rewarding to work in a group.<br />

Knowing how to work in a group is very important to me, because I like to compare myself with colleagues.<br />
While coding, the same thing can be achieved in multiple ways and the dialogue with colleagues is the key to obtaining a perfect result.<br />
I am a curious, hard working and self motivated person, always looking for new challenges and learning opportunities.<br />
