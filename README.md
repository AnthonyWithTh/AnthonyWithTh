# <h3>${\textsf{\color{green}But who Am I?}}$</h3>

>*That’s one secret I’ll never tell... [cit.]*<br />

Just kidding! <br />

My name is Anthony, born in 1993. <br />
Since I was a child, I have always had a passion for video games. <br />
However, life choices have led me to study other areas, such as 3D modeling and graphic animations. <br />

In fact, in 2020 I obtained a master's degree with honors from the Faculty of Engineering of Pisa in Building Engineering Architecture. <br />
Throughout my university career I pursued my passion for video games, and only recently I approached the world of programming. <br />
My thesis was a VR application that showed the evolution of a historic building in the Certosa di Pisa in Calci. <br />

This prompted me to undertake a training course for Game Programmer at the Digital Bros Game Academy in Milan, which allowed me to expand my knowledge on the use of Unity and Unreal Engine. <br />
I discovered that coding is very exciting, especially with regard to the study behind the logic of a videogame. <br />
I approached multiple areas, such as Gameplay Logic, Procedural Generation, Debugging, Animation, Shader, UI and VFX. <br />

I found it very rewarding to work in a group, and knowing how to work in a team is very important to me, because I like to compare myself with my colleagues. <br />
While coding, the same thing can be achieved in multiple ways, and the dialogue with them is the key to obtaining a perfect result. <br />
I am a curious, hardworking and self-motivated person, always looking for new challenges and learning opportunities.
